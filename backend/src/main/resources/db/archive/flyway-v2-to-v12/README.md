# Archived Flyway migrations (V2-V12)

These files are preserved for reference after baseline consolidation.

- Active migrations are under `backend/src/main/resources/db/flyway/`.
- Archived files are intentionally outside the active Flyway location.
- Baseline replacement: `backend/src/main/resources/db/flyway/V2__baseline_current_schema.sql`.
